                    <h2>Training</h2>
                    
                    <p>Your training will consist of two main exercises. The first of these is sword training to improve your offensive ability and power. During this training you must test your reflexes by slicing your sword at oncoming attacks at both the right position and time. The second training exercise will be to improve your defensive ability. During this training you will be required to use your shield to block all oncoming attacks from different directions as they come at you. In both of these training exercises the better you perform, the stronger you get. So train hard if you wish to claim the next spot as the Ultimate Gladiator!</p>

                    <p>The arena is where you will be able to truly test your power and improvement from training. You will be pitted against enemies that only get stronger and stronger as you advance, and whether or not you come out victorious will depend on how strong you've become. No gladiator regardless of skill could ever climb to the top unless he has truly maximized his strength in both offense and defense. Train hard and earn your spot at the top of the arena!</p>
